            <h2> Hannah Swirple </h2>
            <h3> Assistant Coach </h3>
            <p> I competed for the University of Michigan Weightlifting team for three years under Coach Robert "Bob" Morris after finding Olympic weightlifting between my freshman and sophomore year of college. My time on the team was transformative to my entire undergraduate experience -- the team gave me an outlet to channel my competitive energy, structure in my day-to-day schedule, and, most importantly, teammates to train with. When my three years on the team were up, I was lucky enough to have the opportunity to return as an assistant coach. I am currently helping new recruits learn the fundamentals of Olympic weightlifting as well as learning the art & science of coaching under Coach Bob. A fun fact about me: half of my knee is permanently numb due to a reconstructive surgery where my surgeon snipped a nerve :) </p>
